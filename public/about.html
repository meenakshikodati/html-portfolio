<h1>About Me</h1>

<p>My name is Meenakshi. I work as an AI Engineer at IBM. I've been with IBM for 5 years now, and during this time, I have build skills in a wide variety of areas like Machine Learning, Data Science, Data Engineering, AI Governance and Business Intelligence. I'm currently exploring the world of Front End Development to learn how to showcase my AI projects in an attractive web interface.</p>

<p>Apart from immersing myself in the tech world, I also enjoy Painting, creating Mandala Art, practicing Carnatic Music, reading crime novels.</p>

<p>On the personal front, I am happily married and live in Austin, TX with my husband, parents-in-law and 2 adorable kids who keep me busy and give me very little time to do the above. We as a family love to travel, especially to scenic places. It is our goal to visit every National Park in the US in the next 5 years. </p>
